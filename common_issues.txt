Fix: Make sure all virtual functions are = 0, I.E.
virtual void Set_Drive(double left_x, double left_y, double right_x, double right_y) = 0;

Error: 
MEMORY PERMISSION ERROR 

Cause 1 : Accessing variables that have been declared in initialize.hpp but not initialized, so when 
you say ```int a;``` in h file, don't give it a value and reference it.

Cause 2 : Using objects that were not created with the ```new``` keyword does this too, I'm not 100% sure why, but 
objects that don't use the ```new``` keyword are completely wack, they're methods might not give you errors in compile,
and it will let you create them, but they're instance variables will have really wierd values, like _time in autotimer 
was always 70000000, even when it was declared as 0 or 1, and sometimes it will just not let you have class variables like
I tried to define a ```int test = 4;``` and it gave me memory permission for that, it's really weird.

Error: Values that are randomly 77594888 or w/e even when declared as like 1

Cause: Using local variables in & capture - for some reason in an object constructor references to this->whatever will work but not 
if you have a variable x defined locally in the context, for ints it will just convert to like 7 mil.

**Don't use ```using namespace std;``` in .h or .hpp files will break on build something about Okapi def or w/e***

Error: Memory Permission - 
Cause: Don't assign motors and shit inside constructor of modules - ALWAYS USE Create() method to assign motors because otherwise
you will assign an extern motor that hasn't been initialized in initialized.cpp yet
